1.Goal
Given some data about where a ball is dropped from, can we predict what bucket it will end up in.?

Problem solving process#
1. Identify data that is relevant to the problem
2. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you are trying to solve
3. Decide on the type of output you are predicting
4.Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your 'features' and labels
5. Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction
