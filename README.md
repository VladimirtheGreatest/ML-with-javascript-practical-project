1.Goal
Given some data about where a ball is dropped from, can we predict what bucket it will end up in.?

Problem solving process#
1. Identify data that is relevant to the problem
2. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you are trying to solve
3. Decide on the type of output you are predicting
4.Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your 'features' and labels
5. Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction





For feature of "Drop Position" Your prediction was right : 27 % of the time
For feature of "Ball bounciness" Your prediction was right : 16 % of the time
For feature of "Ball size" Your prediction was right : 9 % of the time
Considering there are 10 different buckets we have a chance to predict the correct bucket 1 to 10. Drop position will definitely help us to predict the correct bucket since according to our results it is highly affecting our results while ball bounciness and ball size have absolutely no or very low impact on the final result.
